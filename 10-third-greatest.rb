# Write a method that takes an array of numbers in. Your method should
# return the third greatest number in the array. You may assume that
# the array has at least three numbers in it.
#
# Difficulty: medium.


# If i don't use #sort method, but loop, how to solve the problem???????????

# your solution, they should all print true.
